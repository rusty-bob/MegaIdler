## Modes
**Crafting**:  
The bot repeatedly crafts specified items (e.g., Tin Bar). It automatically detects missing materials (e.g., Tin Ore and Coal Ore) and either crafts or purchases them as needed.  

**Leveling**:  
Continuously levels up selected skills (e.g., woodcutting, forging). The bot autonomously gathers required materials. For example, when leveling cooking, it will automatically fish and mine coal ore when supplies run low. For fishing activities, it purchases necessary bait independently.

## Configuration
As of now, the bot does not provide a user-interface, thus all configurations must be done by specifying them in a `game.toml` file or as environment variables.  
You can find a general configuration introduction in the [Config](./config) section and mode-specific details in the respectived `.md` files.  

You find a fully working `game.toml` file in the [example folder](./example).


### Trial / License
