-----------------------------------------------------------


**Crafting**:  
The bot repeatedly crafts specified items (e.g., `Tin Bar`). It automatically detects missing materials (e.g., `Tin Ore` and `Coal Ore`) and either crafts or purchases them as needed.
  
   
**Leveling**:  
Continuously levels up selected skills (e.g., woodcutting, forging). The bot autonomously gathers required materials. For example, when leveling cooking, it will automatically fish and mine coal ore when supplies run low. For fishing activities, it purchases necessary bait independently.


*Important*:  
- If you decide to start any activity that requires fishing, make sure your character has enough gold to buy baits.
- This bot does not support character switching yet. It will also execute the action with the current selected character, so make sure you do not switch characters manually.
