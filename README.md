## Modes
**Crafting**:  
The bot repeatedly crafts specified items (e.g., Tin Bar). It automatically detects missing materials (e.g., Tin Ore and Coal Ore) and either crafts or purchases them as needed.  

**Leveling**:  
Continuously levels up selected skills (e.g., woodcutting, forging). The bot autonomously gathers required materials. For example, when leveling cooking, it will automatically fish and mine coal ore when supplies run low. For fishing activities, it purchases necessary bait independently.  

**Battling**:  
Battles Enemies at a given location. The bot ensures that the character always carries enough Food to the fights and will start crafting if necessary.  

## Configuration
In order to run, the bot requires a valid `auth.toml` (that contains your IdleMMO and MegaIdler authentications) as well as a `game.toml`.  
Use the `configurator.exe` to generate a valid bot config. 

### Trial / License  
The bot is currently free to use while it's in the testing phase.  
Keys can be requested through Discord (tobyyy1858)
